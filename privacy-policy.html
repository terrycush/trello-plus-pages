            <h1>Privacy Policy for Trello Plus</h1>
            <p><em>Last updated: 18 October 2024</em></p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Trello Plus ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information that we receive through our Chrome extension, Trello Plus.</p>

            <h2>Information We Don't Collect</h2>
            <p>Trello Plus is designed to enhance your Trello experience without collecting or transmitting any personal data. We do not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collect any personal information</li>
                <li>Track your browsing history</li>
                <li>Access your Trello account information</li>
                <li>Transmit any data to external servers</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Information We Do Collect</h2>
            <p>Trello Plus operates entirely within your browser and only interacts with Trello.com. The extension:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Reads and modifies the content of web pages you visit on Trello.com</li>
                <li>Stores your preferences locally in your browser's storage</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These preferences include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>List width settings</li>
                <li>Card count display preferences</li>
                <li>Card age display preferences</li>
                <li>Card ID display preferences</li>
                <li>List collapse states</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This information is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API and is not transmitted to us or any third parties.</p>

            <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
            <p>The stored preferences are used solely to customize your Trello experience according to your settings within the extension.</p>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, we do not have access to it. The security of this data is managed by your browser's built-in security features.</p>

            <h2>Changes to Trello's Website</h2>
            <p>Trello Plus interacts with Trello's website to provide its functionality. If Trello makes changes to their website, it may affect the operation of our extension. We strive to update Trello Plus promptly in response to such changes.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Trello Plus does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not use the extension or provide any information through it.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.</p>

            <h2>Contact Us</h2>
