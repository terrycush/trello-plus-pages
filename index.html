                <p>Trello will make future updates to the structure that Trello Plus depends on to function properly. When it does, Trello Plus will stop working.</p>
                <p>Most extensions rely on a structure that may change and I have no control over that.</p>
                <p>I will do my best to make sure Trello Plus is updated and working in-line with any Trello updates.</p>
                <p>Please don't use the Chrome Web Store review system as a way to contact me.</p>
                <p>You will find I'm open to feedback and suggestions and working with you to make Trello Plus better.</p>
                <p>If Trello Plus consistently stops working for you, and I am not aware of any update to Trello, <strong>please reach out</strong> to me.</p>

                <p>Trello Plus is a Chrome extension that enhances your Trello experience by providing additional features and customization options. Here's how to use Trello Plus:</p>
                <h3>Popup</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The extension's popup is located in your browser's toolbar. Click on it to open the popup.</li>
                    <li>The states of the sliders and toggles are global, so they will apply to all Trello boards you are on.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>List Width</h3>
                <ul>

                </ul>

                    <li>You can collapse and expand lists by clicking on the "Expand" and "Collapse" buttons at the top of the board or by clicking the collapse icon in the top right of the list header.</li>
                    <li>If you click an individual list, the collapse state will be saved for that list only.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Card Count</h3>
                <ul>
