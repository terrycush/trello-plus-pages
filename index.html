                <p>Trello will make future updates to the structure that Trello Plus depends on to function properly. When it does, Trello Plus will stop working.</p>
                <p>Most extensions rely on a structure that may change and I have no control over that.</p>
                <p>I will do my best to make sure Trello Plus is updated and working in-line with any Trello updates.</p>
                <p>Please don't use the Chrome Web Store review system as a way to contact me.</p>
                <p>You will find I'm open to feedback and suggestions and working with you to make Trello Plus better.</p>
                <p>If Trello Plus consistently stops working for you, and I am not aware of any update to Trello, please create a post on our community subreddit on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/trelloplus/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>.</p>

                <p>Trello Plus is a Chrome extension that enhances your Trello experience by providing additional features and customization options. Here's how to use Trello Plus:</p>
                <h3>Popup</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The extension's popup is located in your browser's toolbar. Click on it to open the popup.</li>
                    <li>The states of the sliders and toggles are global, so they will apply to all Trello boards you are on.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>List Width</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can adjust the width of the lists by using the slider in the extension's popup.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>List Collapse</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can collapse and expand lists by clicking on the "Expand" and "Collapse" buttons at the top of the board or by clicking the collapse icon in the top right of the list header.</li>
                    <li><strong>Important:</strong> If you click an individual list, the system will remember the state, e.g. you collapse the "To Do" list and browse to a different board. Upon return to the first board the "To Do" list is still collapsed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Important:</strong> Clicking on the "Expand" and "Collapse" buttons at the top of the board will <strong>not</strong> remember the state. I may look at changing this in the future.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Card Count</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can show and hide the number of cards in a list by clicking the "Card Count" toggle in the extension's popup.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Card Age</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first 24 hours of a card's age are displayed in hours, e.g. "3 hours ago".</li>
                    <li>After that, the next 2 days of a card's age are displayed in days, e.g. "2 days ago".</li>
                    <li>After that, the age is displayed as the date the card was created.</li>
                    <li>You can show and hide the age of the cards in a list by clicking the "Card Age" toggle in the extension's popup.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Card ID</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can show and hide the ID of the cards in a list by clicking the "Card ID" toggle in the extension's popup.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Celebration Animation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you move a card to the last list on your board, a celebration animation will play.</li>
                    <li>You can turn this on and off in the extension's popup.</li>
                </ul>
